Hi! I am a M.S. student at LangAGI Lab advised by Jinyoung Yeo. Previously, I received B.S. in Software Engineering from Chung-Ang University in Feb. 2025.

<!-- My recent research interests include: (i) Embodied AI and (ii) Embodied AI with a strong understanding of real-world dynamics. Additionally, I focus on analyzing language models (LMs) to identify limitations and room for improvement. The ultimate goal of my research is to design systems that enable humans to communicate and interact with AI in a trustworthy and beneficial manner. -->

## Topics of interest

- **Embodied AI**: Embodied-Personalization
- **Real-World Challenges**:
